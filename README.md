# UCI HAR Dataset Analysis
DataScience Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository contains the R script that can be used to analysis the UCI HAR Dataset and convert it into a tidy data set.

It also contains the data codebooks describing the orgini, the variables and the structure of the dataset.

The R script does the following

    Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The R code that is used for analysis is available in the run_analysis.R file.
